      The distribution of real-world relationships is unbalanced, existing
      methods perform quite poorly for the less frequent relationships. In this
      work, it is found that the statistical correlations between object pairs
      and their relationships can effectively regularize semantic space and
      make prediction less ambiguous, and thus address the unbalanced
      distribution issue.

      provides a deeper understanding for the image and facilities various

      Existing methods for scene graph generation rely on target object regions
      or contextual cues to aid recognition, which require large amounts of
      annotated samples for model optimization while the distribution of
      real-world relationships is unbalanced and lead to poor performance for
      those with limited training samples.

      Objects in visual scene commonly have strongly structured regularities
      (according to SMN). Modeling these statistical correlations between
      object pairs and relationships can effectively regularize the semantic
      prediction space, and thus address the unbalanced distribution issue.
